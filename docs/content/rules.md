## 1. Stake Your Intent
Before joining any advanced quests, you must place a **Commitment Stake**. 
- **Why?** To filter out noise and ensure every participant is serious about building.
- **Is it a fee?** No. It is a deposit that will be returned upon successful completion of your mission.

## 2. Build or Forfeit
- **Success:** Complete the quest, submit a valid PR, and pass the review to get your stake back + Reputation XP.
- **Inactivity:** If you disappear or fail to deliver within the timeframe, your stake will be moved to the **Operations Fund** to support the community.
