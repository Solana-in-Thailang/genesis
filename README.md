# Solana Thailand Genesis: A Transparent & Meritocratic Developer Community

> **"We build the system, the system builds the builders."**

Welcome to **Solana Thailand Genesis** — a workspace for Shippable Builders. We are a **Community-Led Organization** driven by transparency through GitHub; every decision is auditable (**Provable Governance**). We operate on a **Meritocracy** system that prioritizes Proof of Work over token holding.

## The System: Proof of Work over Tokenomics
To maintain quality and ensure only serious participants join, we use a **Commitment Stake** system:

1.  **Commitment Stake:** Here, you stake SOL to "buy the right to prove your skills." Participants must transfer SOL to the vault to confirm their intent to join a Quest.
2.  **Build:** Complete the mission (Quest) or project according to the specified conditions.
3.  **Unstake:** Once the work (PR/Issue) is submitted and merged, the stake is returned immediately.
4.  **Forfeit:** If you abandon the task or disappear, the stake will be forfeited to the **Treasury** to support further community development.

## Ranks & Reputation (Governance)
Decision-making rights and system direction are based on **Reputation** accumulated through contributions:

### Core Maintainers (The Guardians)
* **👑 Owner:** System Architect & Strategic Lead ([@katopz](https://github.com/katopz))
* **✨ Holy Crab:** Mentors, Approvers & Judges (Authority based on Reputation)
* **🦀 King Crab:** Community Operator & Project Manager ([@ozoneRatchapon](https://github.com/ozoneRatchapon))

### Community Ranks (The Path)
* **🐺 Lone Wolf:** High-level Developer focused on solo contributions (Special Contributor)
* **🏹 Job Hunter (Rank 3):** Proven builders ready for mid-level tasks/bounties.
* **🔨 Builder (Rank 2):** Those who completed Quests (Unstaked) and demonstrated actual coding skills.
* **🛡️ Challenger (Rank 1):** Those who have placed a Stake and are currently in training.
* **👀 Spectator (Rank 0):** General observers in Discord.
